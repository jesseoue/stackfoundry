# Security Headers Maintenance Instructions

- Preserve the ownership and setup guidance in `docs.md`.
- Keep source templates small and provider-neutral.
- Update `tests/checklist.md` with behavior changes.
- Do not commit secrets, local state, or generated machine metadata.

## Shared Skills

When provider, framework, or database behavior changes, load the installed shared skill before editing implementation details:

- `.stackfoundry/skills/nextjs/SKILL.md` (source: `registry/skills/nextjs/SKILL.md`)

Keep this module skill focused on ownership, installed files, env vars, deployment checks, and module-specific invariants.
